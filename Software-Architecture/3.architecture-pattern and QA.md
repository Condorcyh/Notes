#### 一. Overview

​	In this assignment,  I do a lot of researches about architecture patterns,  quality attributes and tactics as well as the relationship among them.  It takes me  **four days**  to finish this work. 

####  二.  Avilibility

##### 1. Relation between patterns and tatics

​	During my research, I found that patterns may use tatics in many **different ways**.  In this table, I discuss two relationships.  ✘ means the tactic may improve the pattern, but there are also other tactics used often or most real world implentations do not include the tactic.  ✔︎ means most the tactic is very helpful to the pattern and also involved in **most** real world implentations.

##### 2. Patterns' impact on attributes

1. **Broker pattern**  can improve availability because the broker pattern makes it easy to replace a failed server with another. So if one service fails, there are always another service available. 
2. **Client-server pattern**.   If servers are replicated, it is easy to improve availability, which is the benefit to avalibility.  But is there is only one server, one point failure would be very common, which add penalty to avalibility.
3. **Peer-to-peer pattern**.   In peer to peer pattern, many nodes perform the same function,  if one of them fails，there are always another nodes to replace. So the availability can be improved using peer-to-peer pattern.  **However**, if there are not enough nodes, the availability can not be improved.
4. **Shared-data pattern**.  The data store in the shared-data patteren can be a single point of failure. So the availability maybe very poor.  Also the avalibility can be improved using many different data stores. 
5. **Multi-tier pattern**.   Tiers applied to runtime entities can make it easier to. ensure availability.



##### 3. Tactics that might not associated with most patterns

​	In this part, I mainly discuss **why** these tactics are **not included** in the above table.

1. **Software upgrade**.   This tactic is not associated with most pattern because upgrading software is not the thing that patterns care about or it is not important to these patterns.
2. **Shadow**.    Shadow is about how to recover from failure,  but patterns usually don't care about how to recover. 
3. **Escalating restart**.  This is about the stategy to restart system,  patterns usually don't have to concern with how to restart. 
4. **Removal from service**.  This strategy is more about a decision which decide part of the system not to work to prevent failure.  Patterns usually don't make these decisions. 
5. **Predictive model**.  This is more like a concrete algorithm, and patterns usually do not predict, at least the patterns above. 

#### 三. Interoperability

##### 2. Patterns' impact on attributes

1. **Broker pattern**. The broker pattern makes it easy to the customers and providers.  So it improves the interoperablity a lot. 
2. **Service-Oriented Architecture pattern**.  The main bebefit and the major driver of SOA is interoperability. Because service providers and service consumers may run on different platforms, wittern in different languages and still work fine.

##### 3. Tactics that might not associated with most patterns

All the tactics mentioned in the book are applied in some of the patterns.    

#### 四. performance

##### 1.Relation between patterns and tatics

![](/Users/law/Documents/软件体系结构/performance.png)

#####2. Patterns' impact on attributes 

1. **Broker pattern**.   The  broker can help find the providers that are not that busy and this improve the performance to some extent. And broker is an extra layer and certainly add lantency to the excution.  
2. **Pipe and Filter patter**.  Filters are independent to each other and can be excuted in parallelism,  and this improves performance.
3. **Client-server pattern**.   The server can  be the bottleneck of performance and replicate servers can improve performance.  
4. **Peer-to-peer pattern**.  There are always more than one nodes perform the same function which reduces the time of hanling and thus improve the performance.
5. **map-reduce pattern**.  Data are mapped into many independent parts and thus are be reduced concurrently, which improves performance. 
6. **Multi-tier pattern**.    Tiers applied to runtime entities can make it easier to improve performance of certain framework. 
7. **layered  pattern**.    Laying always add a performance penalty to a system. If a call is made to a function in the top-most layer, this may have to traverse many lower layers before being executed by the hardware. 
8. **Service-Oriented Architecture pattern**.  Like broker pattern,  the middle part of the pattern can add lantency to a system, and that is a performance penalty. 
9. **Publish-subscrib pattern pattern**.  There is miiddle part of the pattern adding  lantency between publisher and subscriber which is a performance penalty. 

##### 3. Tactics that might not associated with most patterns

​	In this part, I mainly discuss **why** these tactics are **not included** in the above table.

1. **Manage sampling rate**  This is more about a decision made by just quality attributes and not determined by any patterns. We decide sampling rate according to the real world constraints. 
2. **Limit event response**.   This is a common decision made by many systems and it is not just determined by any patterns. 
3. **Prioritize events**.    Nearly all the systems would take some algorithms to determine the most prioritized events which we can not say certain pattern apply this tatic. 
4. **Reduce overhead**.   This is a common problem of many patterns.  Some paterns can apply this tactic, but not the patterns we list before.
5. **Bound execution times**.   This is a common scenese to any pattern, so we cannot say this tactic is applied in any patterns. 
6. **Bound queue sizes**.   This a common methods used in many applications, but it does not belong to a certain pattern.

#### 五. Security

##### 1. Relation between patterns and tatics

![](/Users/law/Documents/软件体系结构/security.png)

##### 2. Patterns' impact on attributes 

1. **Multi-tier pattern**.   Tiers applied to runtime entities can make it easier to improve security of certain part of the system.
2. **Broker pattern**.  The broker is easy to attack and that is very dangerous, so the broker add a security penalty to the system. 
3. **client-server-pattern**.  If the server is attacked,  many important data will lost, which add a security penalty to the system.
4. **Peer-to-Peer**.   We a put different important data to differnent nodes in peer-to-peer pattern, so it becomes easy to achieve security.
5. **Service-Oriented Architecture**.    The servcie is out of the system, so the security of the system is determined by other system, which adds a security penalty to the system. 
6. **Shared-data**.   If the data stores of the pattern is attacked,  all the important data will lost, which add a security penalty to the system.

##### 3. Tactics that might not associated with most patterns

​	In this part, I mainly discuss **why** these tactics are **not included** in the above table.

1. **Detect message delay**.  This is a very useful tactic, but none of the patterns above id about this parts of the system. 
2. **Revoke access**.  This is more about a decision according to the environment, which is not something that a pattern can decide. 
3. **Lock computer**.   This is a very specific solution and is a common scense to everyone,  and a pattern cannot describ this. 
4. **Inform actors**.   Almost every applications in real world use this tactic, and this can not just belong to some certain patterns. 

#### 六.  Testability 

##### 1. Relation between patterns and tatics

![](/Users/law/Documents/软件体系结构/Testability.png)

##### 2.  Patterns' impact on attributes 

1. **Layered pattern**.    Layed pattern makes sure that differnet functions are in different layers,  so complexity of the system is very low.  And that makes it very easy to test. 
2. **MVC pattern**.    MVC pattern seperate the views, controllers and models and that also reduce the complexity of teh system, which makes it very easy to test.  
3. **Pipe-and-Filter pattern**.  FIlters are independent in this pattern, so filters can be tested seperately, which makes it easy to test. 
4. **Publish-Subscribe pattern**. Publishers and subscribers are nearly independent, so we can also test them seperately, which makes it very easy to test. 
5. **Map-Reduce pattern**.   Map parts and reduce parts of the system can be tested seperately, which makes it very easy to test. 
6. **Service-Oriented Architecture pattern**.   The system has to communicate to many other systems in this pattern, so it can be hard to test,   which add a testability penalty to the system. 
7. **Broker pattern pattern**.  The broker part of the system can be very complex and very hard to test, which add a testability penalty to the system. 
8. **Peer-to-Peer pattern**.  The scale of the system can be very large and there may be too many nodes, which makes it very hard to test. 

##### 3. Tactics that might not associated with most patterns

​	In this part, I mainly discuss **why** these tactics are **not included** in the above table.

1. **Specialized interfaces**. This is a tactic in the coding level which is not what any architecture patterns can decide.  
2. **Record/playback** . This is not the things in the architecture level, and not belongs to any specific architecture patterns.
3. **Localize state storage**.    This is a tactic in the coding level which is not what  any architecture pattern can decide.  
4. **Sandbox**    This a common test techique, and the above architecture patterns do not include this test technique. 
5. **Executable assertions**.   This is coding level tactic, and architecture patterns do not decide how to code. 

#### 七. Usability 

##### 1. Relation between patterns and tatics

##### 2.   Patterns' impact on attributes 

1. **Pipe and Filter pattern**.  This pattern maybe very good to the undo tactic, and thus improve the usability. 
2. **MVC pattern**.  MVC pattern can makes it easy to make interactive systems,  which improves the usability.  

##### 3. Tactics that might not associated with most patterns

​	In this part, I mainly discuss **why** these tactics are **not included** in the above table.

1. **Cancel**.   It is more like a specific functional requirement, and can be implemented in may different ways, and is cerntainly not involed in any patterns. 
2. **Pause/resume**.   Patterns concern about how to design, not function requirements,  so this may not be involed in any patterns.
3. **Maintain task model**.   This is a algorithm used in system,  but none of the patterns above use this tactic. 
4. **Maintain user model**    This can be seen ad an algorithm or a decision made by function requirements, and is not involed in the patterns above. 
5. **Maintain system model**   It is more like a specific functional requirement, and can be implemented in may different ways, and is cerntainly not involed in any patterns.
